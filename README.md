The Space Management System is a web application that we will implement, called SpaceShri. As NASA for united states, for Sri Lanka there is not any space management or astronomy management system. As well as Sri Lankans are not doing any further study or innovation in this sector. Therefore, enthusiasts in this sector do not try to study more about innovative things. So, we decided to implement a space management system for Sri Lanka, and we hope that this will help to increase the knowledge of people in Sri Lanka about this field.
